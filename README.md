# Password-Gen-R 🧑‍💻
## What is it? How does it work, huh? 🤔
Before we get into that, you may check it out [here](https://raccai.github.io/Password-Gen-R/), [here](https://raccai.github.io/Password-Gen-R/), and [here](https://raccai.github.io/Password-Gen-R/). <br />
Now, Password-Gen-R generates a password for you with a few simple clicks and provides you the options to include at least **1** of the following in the generation of your password:
- Uppercase Letters
- Lowercase Letters
- Symbols
- Numbers

Once you've decided, you can decide on the length of the generated password, ranging from the sane length of 5 to the insanity-inducing length of 30 characters. <br /> <br />
When all is finished, click the "Generate" button on the bottom of the card and see your password be generated in a jiffy, over and over until you are satisfied with the combo. When you are, feel free to click the "Copy" button to use it. 😎

## How to run? 😭
If you want to run it on your own, clone this repo into your machine and install the necessary dependencies by inputting the following code in the command line while in your cloned version: <br />

```
npm install
```

When that's done, input the following code and you're all good: <br />

```
npm run dev
```

Enjoy generating passwords no human will remember (except you, I mean)!
